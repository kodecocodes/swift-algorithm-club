 up to be the same in terms of complexity. That said, tail call
 elimination is not mutually exclusive to recursion.

 The binary GCD algorithm, also known as Stein's algorithm,
 is an algorithm that computes the greatest common divisor of two
 nonnegative integers. Stein's algorithm uses simpler arithmetic
 operations than the conventional Euclidean algorithm; it replaces
 division with arithmetic shifts, comparisons, and subtraction.
 
 - Parameter m: First natural number
 - Parameter n: Second natural number
 - Returns: The natural gcd of m and n
 - Complexity: worst case O(n^2), where n is the number of bits
 in the larger of the two numbers. Although each step reduces
 at least one of the operands by at least a factor of 2,
 the subtract and shift operations take linear time for very
 large integers
